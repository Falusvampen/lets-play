regarding 403 errors, this is in the spring main documentation.

There are several factors that can trigger a 403 error in a Spring Boot application. One of them is when the client fails to provide the authentication credentials. In such cases, the server, unable to verify the clientâ€™s privileges, rejects the request, resulting in a 403 error.
